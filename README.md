A simple e-commerce web project built as part of a web programming lesson. This project demonstrates the basics of backend and frontend development.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment and activate it
python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate # in Linux
venv\Scripts\activate # in Windows

# Install the project requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the project
python run.py
```

After that, for the frontend:

```bash
# Go to the frontend directory and start the local server
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8000

# Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/index.html
```
